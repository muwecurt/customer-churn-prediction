# Telecoms Customer Churn prediction

Preventing customer churn is a key element of modern businesses because of the improved performance it offers.

The benefits of predicting customer churn are many but most impactful to the company are the actions that follow.

## Project Objective

The objective of this model is to identify the customers with the highest possibility of churning so as to develop better retention strategies, and to roll out operational practices that will keep customers from walking out the door.

The project builds a customer churn prediction model using data from a telecommunications company.
